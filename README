# netX openOCD scripts

These scripts can be used to connect to evaluation boards from Hilscher that come with an FTDI chip on Boards, or using a JTAGkey from Amontech.

The following boards can be used directly:
 * NXHX500-RE / -ETM
 * NXHX50-RE / -ETM
 * NXHX10-RE / -ETM
 * NXHX51-RE / -ETM
 * NXHX90-JTAG

Sample scripts using JTAGkey Tiny for different boards and the CPU itself are also available.

### Usage:

Prerequisites:
 * openOCD-0.10.0
 * Appropriate Hilscher netX Evaluation Board or a JTAGkey

Just start openocd and pass the proper config script / search dir as follows:
  openocd -s <scriptdir> -f <scriptdir>\config\nxhx500_re.cfg

or use the standard openOCD method:
  openocd -s <scriptdir> -f <scriptdir>\interface\hilscher_nxhx500_re.cfg -f <scriptdir>\board\hilscher_nxhx500.cfg

### Notes:
 * These files have been tested with openOCD-0.8.0 (under linux) using the new ftdi (via libusb) driver from 2014-04-27
