# netX openOCD scripts

These scripts can be used to connect to evaluation boards from Hilscher that come with an FTDI chip on Boards, or using a JTAGkey from Amontech.

The following boards can be used directly:
 * NXHX500-RE / -ETM
 * NXHX50-RE / -ETM
 * NXHX10-RE / -ETM

Sample scripts using JTAGkey Tiny for different boards and the CPU itself are also available.

### Usage:

Prerequisites:
 * openOCD-0.5.0 / openOCD-dev (for openOCD 0.4.0 please use the openocd-0.4.0 branch)
 * Appropriate Hilscher netX Evaluation Board or a JTAGkey

Just start openocd and pass the proper config script as follows:
  openocd-ftd2xx -f config\nxhx500_re.cfg
  
### Notes:
 * These files have been tested with openOCD-dev-0.5.0 from 09-01-2010
